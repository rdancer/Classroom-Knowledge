WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO

    "I suggest something like an XML backend containing class-room knowledge,
with a generate button which displays one of 5 premade GUI forms displaying the
content in various layouts. Use some Qt animations etc to spice it up, add
scripting support so you can modify various properties in runtime, possibly
later have some graph views, perhaps have an embedded OpenGL viewport with some
random ass junk on it (just to show you can)."

CLOSING THOUGHTS

    "I ended the compile a while ago - I can't remember having to go through
that turmoil. It was using too much of my time."
